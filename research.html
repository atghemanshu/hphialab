              Biological essences or highly concentrated aromatic plant
              essences that are used in aromatherapy are known to have varying
              medicinal properties. It has been claimed that these essences
              facilitate physiological properties such as relieving pain,
              combating bacteria, fighting viral infections, relieving
              indigestion and improving circulation. Such essences have also
              been connected to emotional properties such as easing nervous
              tension, grounding, increasing concentration, calming and
              balancing, enhancing creativity and boosting confidence. Through
              scientific research in the lab, Phia has worked to fill in the
              gaps in understanding how biological essences from the botanical
              world impact our health and wellness.

            Biological essences have a unique, distinguishable and quantifiable

            Essences fall into one of six different categories or Energy Waves
            based on their energy fingerprint.
          </li>
          <li>
            The distinct energy of the essences seems to be tied to the
            emotional properties.

          <li>
            A code of major and minor chemical constituents can represent each
            of the six Energy Waves.
          </li>
          <li>
            These Energy Waves can be matched using a “best fit” model to one’s
            signature frequency.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a positive effect on the wellness of a person interacting
            with an Energy Wave that is a constructive match to their signature
            frequency.

        Traditional aromatherapy recommends lavender for better sleep. A blend
        of lavender and magnolia may be used to appeal to individual scent
        preferences. According to Phia research, this combination is
        counterproductive because lavender and magnolia have destructive
        frequencies. These essences interact in a destructive pattern that
        dissipates the effect of each essence on its own. Furthermore, lavender
        may be effective for some of us if it matches our signature frequency
        in a constructive way. Without this match, lavender could be destructive
        to our energy body.

        At Phia Lab, we combine essences based on their energy fingerprint,
        thereby supercharging the energy contained in our products and the
        effect they can have you. This effect increases exponentially when the
        frequency contained in the bottle is in a constructive pattern to the
        frequency of the user. To simplify the concept of combining essences,
        consider how music is created on the piano. Certain keys can be played
        together to create harmony. Add a key with a different vibration and you
        will hear dissonance. In essence, we are harmonizing biological essences
        by measuring and categorizing their vibrations. Phia formulas apply phi
        proportions or sacred geometry to synchronize the energy further.
