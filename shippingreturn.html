    <h1 id="shipping-title">SHIPPING & RETURNS</h1>

    <h2 id="shipping-subtitle">DOMESTIC SHIPPING</h2>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      We ship as speedy as we can from our lab in Denver so you can start experiencing your Phia product. Orders are processed with care and positive intention by our team and are pushed out the door in 1 to 3 business days. Depending on the order, we use UPS Ground and USPS Priority as standard shipping service.
    </p>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      We estimate transit time at 2 to 3 days, depending on your distance from Colorado. Please contact us via the contact form on the website if you have any shipping questions or if you need something to ship more quickly. Also, please add any extra delivery instructions to the comment section of your order.
    </p>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      Phia Lab offers free standard shipping on all orders over $90.00, excluding tax, and after promotional discounts are applied. Otherwise, we charge a flat fee of $9.95 for standard shipping.
    </p>

    <h2 id="shipping-subtitle">INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING</h2>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      International shipments may require additional duties and taxes to be paid by the customer at the time of delivery, which are not covered in our shipping rates. Make sure to check with your local postal service or customs office to find out what these fees will be before you place an order. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
    </p>

    <h2 id="shipping-subtitle">DAMAGED SHIPMENTS</h2>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      We use premium shipping services with high quality carriers to provide the best possible shipping and customer care. We also pack and prepare each box ourselves to protect the precious cargo for its journey to you. However, surprises can happen. If you see major external damage to your package or any other issues with delivery, please take a picture of your package before opening it and send it to us. If the package has been damaged in some way inside the box, please take a picture of the problem and send it as well. We will do everything we can to turn a problem into a force of good!
    </p>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      If you believe your package was lost or stolen, please contact us as soon as possible with your order number and tracking number (please be prepared to provide an alternative and secure address for a second delivery attempt).
    </p>

        <h2 id="shipping-subtitle">RETURN POLICY</h2>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      We put a lot of energy into preparing the product and we want you to love your Phia purchase! If you are not satisfied, please contact us via the contact form on the website within 90 days of your purchase, and we will provide a return authorization and mailing information. Please return the unused portion, and we will remit your account for the full amount of your purchase, less shipping.
    </p>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      Please Note: only items purchased on <a href="https://www.phialab.com" class="text-decoration-none " target="_blank">www.phialab.com</a> may be accepted for return. If you purchased your Phia product at one of our spa partners, please contact them for assistance.
    </p>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      We cannot ensure that we will be able to properly locate and handle your return or exchange without the return authorization and the correct return address. We recommend that your return or exchange is sent via FedEx, UPS or insured Parcel Post for your protection and to insure prompt delivery. We're sorry, but shipping fees are non-refundable. You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs when returning your item.
    </p>
    <p id="shipping-text">
      If you are shipping an item over $75.00, we recommend that you use a shipping service with reliable tracking, or that you purchase shipping insurance. If not, we cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
    </p>
     <p id="shipping-text">
     Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a 5-10 business days.
    <p id="shipping-text">
    If you would like to return a gift, we can provide a gift credit for the value of your return if the item was shipped directly to you.    </p>
